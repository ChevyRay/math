# math
This is a math library I'm currently using for some personal projects, mostly graphics-related. This isn't extensively tested, and not designed for public use yet (the API could have breaking changes at any point).

Mostly, this is for me to figure out what a comfortable math API for me is like in Rust.

If you want a really good, really fast vector math lib for graphics/games/etc., I recommend [glam](https://crates.io/crates/glam), which has some SIMD support and boasts some pretty impressive benchmarks.
